## Git Usage

In this project I try to make proper use of git and continuous deployment. For this I have the following branch setup:

```
master (auto deploys) ______________________
                       \               /
development             \_____________/- pull request
                         \           /
features                  \_commits_/- pull request
```

This app makes its information available in many languages and that could not have been possible without the help of these awesome internationals that care about doing good in this world.
